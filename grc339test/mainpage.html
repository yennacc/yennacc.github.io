            <h1>Middle Joffre Lake</h1>
            <p>It took my friend and I two hours of hiking and a bunch of mosquitos bites to get to this place. The hike was hard for me because I don't used to hike a lot, but the view was worth it! I would go again.</p>

            <p>Last Summer, I visited Seattle they have a really nice weather during Summer and the sun goes down until 10pm, I was so surprised about that. I miss the weather, and I hope that I will have the opportunity to go there again.</p>

            <p>This photo was taken in Spring 2019 in the parking lot of Cerro Vista at 1:00 am. I was scared by a deer because it ran out from the hill, I was shocked and didn't move at all and then it left. It was a great experience finding the milkyway and taking this picture.</p>

            <h1>Guangzhou</h1>
            <p>One of the best bakeries I have ever tried! It is located in Guangzhou. They used to have a lot of people waiting in line, but it was almost closing so we didn't have to wait so much for our order. When I travelled to China, I walked a lot every day because it was so hard to find a place to park and it was so hot in Summer over there.</p>

            <p>On Summer 2019, I went to China where I visited my friends and my parents' hometown. I miss the street foods of China, it is so good!</p>
